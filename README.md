# Stock Manager
This is a work-in-progress version of the stock management application as found in [this repo](https://github.com/DeonJordaan/bc-stock-manager). A live version can be seen [here](https://bc-stock-manager.netlify.app/).

Whereas that is built using React (with another branch running in TypeScript), I initially attempted the application with OOP & TypeScript. Both of those being quite new to me, I had some trouble getting it to function.

I'll be spending some time here still...
